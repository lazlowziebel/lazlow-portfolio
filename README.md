## About

I’m a GIS and urban planning professional pursuing my Master of Science in Urban & Regional Planning at the University of Iowa, with a concentration in Housing, Community, and Economic Development. I use GIS, spatial analysis, and cartography to support community planning, affordable housing, economic development, and data-informed decision-making.

I’ve worked as a GIS Intern with the City of Crystal Lake’s Zoning & Planning Department and as a FEMA CRS Intern with River Action, focusing on flood safety, stormwater management, and Upper Mississippi River communities. I also have experience as a Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant supporting students and faculty through instruction, data analysis, and research.
