I'm a GIS and urban planning professional pursuing my Master of Science in Urban & Regional Planning at the University of Iowa. My work focuses on spatial analysis, cartography, community planning, flood resilience, and data-driven policy evaluation. I enjoy building maps, visualizing complex datasets, and using geospatial tools to support equitable and resilient planning outcomes.
